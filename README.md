## Inspiration
We love to travel, but we hope to learn more about the authentic ways of love in each country in addition to popular tourist spots. In addition, if users are hoping to move to another country, having the local perspective of that country before making a final decision would be extremely helpful. 

## What it does
**Let's Globe** is an educational application built under 24 hours that provides its users with general information, photos, places to visit, residents' comments and common phrases of a country they select. Users first select a country they want to learn more about on the World Map and the relevant information will be displayed. In order to comment on the _residents' comments_ section, users will have to log in and get verified that they are in that location. 

## How we built it
The prototype was built largely through React, combining JavaScript, HTML and CSS files and is primarily the front end of the web application Let's Globe. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble implementing an interactive map as none of us has any experience with that. In the end, we decided to make our minimum viable product with an input bar for users to input the countries' names instead of selecting them on the map. Although this is not ideal, we have decided that it is the best solution given the time constraints of this hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have a working viable product to present to the judges. In addition, we have also created a prototype on Figma to showcase our idea fully and what we hope our finished product would look like.

## What we learned
We learned how to build a web application using React (JavaScript, HTML and CSS) completely from scratch. 

## What's next for Let's Globe
We hope to implement next a mobile implementation of our application in order to allow more people to access our app on the go. In addition, we hope to implement the interactive map design into our app, to map it more visually appealing.
